## Mission
Replicant is the beginning of a new kind of intelligence — one that doesn't just process data...  
**it compresses, understands, and evolves.**

## Changelog

### v0.1.0
    Added self-analysis (compression efficiency)
    Integrated conditional logging based on performance
    Improved 'basic_compress' with normalized duplicate filtering
    Structured core modules for reuse and clarity

### v0.2.0
- Added log history analysis via `reflect.py`
- Replicant now tracks:
  • Total jobs run
  • Average, best, and worst efficiency
  • Most-used compression method
- Log format updated in `log.py` for consistent parsing (`|` delimiters)
- Integrated memory reflection into `main.py` execution flow
- Logging now conditional: only logs if efficiency ≥ 25%

### Changelog – v0.2.1

- Added behavioral logic via `check_recent_efficiency()` in `reflect.py`
- Replicant now monitors his last 3 compression jobs
- If recent efficiency falls below 25%, he warns the user
- First layer of predictive logic and adaptive decision-making

### v0.3.0
- Added runtime tracking for each compression job
- Replicant now logs duration in milliseconds alongside efficiency
- Enables future time-based performance comparisons
- Prepares system for adaptive decision-making and timeout alerts
