## Mission
Replicant is the beginning of a new kind of intelligence ‚Äî one that doesn't just process data...  
**it compresses, understands, and evolves.**

## Changelog

### v0.1.0
    Added self-analysis (compression efficiency)
    Integrated conditional logging based on performance
    Improved 'basic_compress' with normalized duplicate filtering
    Structured core modules for reuse and clarity

### v0.2.0
- Added log history analysis via `reflect.py`
- Replicant now tracks:
  ‚Ä¢ Total jobs run
  ‚Ä¢ Average, best, and worst efficiency
  ‚Ä¢ Most-used compression method
- Log format updated in `log.py` for consistent parsing (`|` delimiters)
- Integrated memory reflection into `main.py` execution flow
- Logging now conditional: only logs if efficiency ‚â• 25%

### v0.2.1

- Added behavioral logic via `check_recent_efficiency()` in `reflect.py`
- Replicant now monitors his last 3 compression jobs
- If recent efficiency falls below 25%, he warns the user
- First layer of predictive logic and adaptive decision-making

### v0.3.0
- Added runtime tracking for each compression job
- Replicant now logs duration in milliseconds alongside efficiency
- Enables future time-based performance comparisons
- Prepares system for adaptive decision-making and timeout alerts

### v0.3.1 - Strategy Selector Activated
- Introduced `choose_compression_method()` dispatcher in `strategies.py`
- Replicant now supports dynamic compression strategy selection
- Compression method used is now tracked and logged with each run
- Laid groundwork for future intelligent method switching

### v0.3.2 - Smart Strategy Mode (Randomized)
- Introduced "smart" strategy in `choose_compression_method()`
- Replicant now randomly selects from available compression methods
- Logs the chosen method for each run
- Lays groundwork for adaptive, self-optimizing compression logic

### v0.4.0 - Adaptive Compression Intelligence
- Smart strategy now selects the most effective compression method based on log history
- Integrated Replicant‚Äôs first performance-driven decision loop
- Fallback logic ensures continued operation with no logs
- Paves the way for real-time learning and predictive logic

### v0.5.0 - User Feedback Integration
- Replicant now asks the user to rate each compression run (good/bad/skip)
- Feedback is logged to a new file: `user_feedback.log`
- Added emoji-based responses to personalize interaction
- This marks Replicant‚Äôs first step toward emotional intelligence and user-driven optimization

### v0.6.1 ‚Äì Stability Monitoring Patch
- Implemented `check_recent_efficiency()` to monitor recent compression averages
- Replicant now issues an emotional warning üòï if average efficiency drops too low
- Marks the beginning of self-awareness and proactive diagnostic alerts

### v0.7.0 ‚Äì Autonomous Pivoting
- Replicant now monitors his own compression history and changes strategies automatically
- Introduced `override_strategy` logic to adapt when efficiency drops
- Core decision-making ability achieved ‚Äî first signs of intelligent behavior

### v0.8.0
- Added smart strategy selection based on best-performing method
- Normalized log history method names to strategy keys
- Resolved compatibility bug with legacy logs
- Added alert for recent efficiency drops
- Feedback now summarized and used to influence decisions

## [0.8.0] - Smarter Strategy + Log Awareness

- `main.py` now adapts strategy based on feedback and efficiency trends
- New function `get_best_performing_method()` added to reflect.py
- Feedback summaries now persist across sessions and influence decisions
- Stability and structure cleanup across reflect, strategies, and main
